        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Qore Lending was founded in South Africa with a simple mission: to bridge the gap between local investors seeking high returns
          and SA businesses needing capital to grow. We recognized that traditional South African banking often leaves both sides
          underserved - investors earn minimal returns from bank deposits while businesses struggle to access affordable capital.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Our innovative approach connects these two needs within the South African market, creating a win-win scenario where investors earn
          substantial returns while local businesses get the funding they need to thrive and contribute to SA's economic growth.

      <!-- Why We Need Your Investment -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why We Need Your Investment</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We have a growing number of qualified South African businesses seeking capital for expansion, equipment purchases,
          and working capital needs. These are established SA companies with strong fundamentals, good BEE credentials,
          and the ability to pay competitive interest rates.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          However, we find ourselves running out of available capital to meet this demand from the SA market. Your investment
          allows us to fund more loans to local businesses, which in turn generates the returns we share with our investors.
